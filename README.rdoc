= EaselBox

EaselBox is a Javascript wrapper for the EaselJS canvas rendering library and the Box2dWeb physics engine.  It makes it easy to create objects that have Box2d's physics, as well as Easel's powerful rendering capabilities.

EaselBox adds convenience methods to create those objects, as well as giving you direct access to the underlying EaselJS and Box2dWeb entities if you'd like to manipulate them directly.
